# v1.0.0

This is the launch version of EmuSync - thanks for downloading! 

This has been solo developed for my own use, so if you come across any bugs or have requests for features, please raise them in the issues section of the EmuSync GitHub page.

I plan to keep this maintained as long as there's interest. I work full-time though, so responses to bugs and feature requests might take a while.

Otherwise, I hope you enjoy using EmuSync. If you like it, please consider starring it on GitHub or sharing it with your friends.

Many thanks,
Rhys
