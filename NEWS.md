## Decky plugin for SteamDeck users
There is a now Decky plugin available for SteamDeck users! Please check out how to download and use it [here](https://github.com/emu-sync/EmuSync-DeckyPlugin).

The status of your game syncs can now be checked via the Decky plugin, as well as manually syncing your game saves - no more hopping into desktop mode each time.

## Local game backups & restore mechanism
The latest version of EmuSync will now keep local backups whenever it downloads new files, so if something goes horribly wrong, there is a now a disaster recovery option!

Read more about game backups [here](https://github.com/emu-sync/EmuSync/wiki/Local-game-backups).
