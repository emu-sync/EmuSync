## Decky plugin for SteamDeck users
There is a now Decky plugin available for SteamDeck users! Please check out how to download and use it [here](https://github.com/emu-sync/EmuSync-DeckyPlugin).

The status of your game syncs can now be checked via the Decky plugin, as well as manually syncing your game saves - no more hopping into desktop mode each time.

## Features I plan to add

- Device specific sync log/history so you can review when saves were uploaded from/downloaded to the device.
- Local backups of game save files whenever new files are downloaded to a device.
  - This will also include a restore from backup mechanism.
